              "I'm a Data Scientist.. I don't need to write clean code because most of my code is
              throwaway anyways". "Clean code and agile are good for developing softwares.. It does
              not make sense in my work". The number of times I have heard the above and the
              reluctance to even try some of the suggestions on clean code, baffles me.
            </p>
            <p>
              Well, let me tell you.. you don't need to write clean code for software development
              either. You don't need to practice agile for software development either. One can make
              a perfectly working software even without the above (maintaining, modifying, scaling
              will get difficult. But that's not the focus of this article). When you need to follow
              clean code practices is when you are working in a TEAM. Irrespective of whether you
              are developing a software or an algorithm or have to try out multiple algorithms.
            </p>
            <p>
              The basic idea of clean code is that your fellow team members should be able to
              understand what you have written. This is especially important in data science. As a
              scientist your experiments <strong>must be reproducible. Must be verifiable.</strong>
              That means others on your team should be able to understand and reproduce your
              results.
            </p>
            <p>
              We exist in a team. It is impossible to be a data scientist by yourself. Most of the
              times in industry you would be working in applied sciences. This means you have to
              understand someone else's problem and they (team, business folks) too need to
              understand your solution.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a data scientist you would have frequent interactions with the following members
              (not limited to) of the team:
            </p>
            <p>
              - Other data scientist/data analyst - collaborate with other data scientist on
              algorithms, models, interpreting the results, feature engineering, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
              - Data engineers - you don't want to end up processing all the data yourself. Queries
              can be optimized by data engineers to get your consolidated results in a minimal time.
              They need to understand what data you need.
            </p>
            <p>
              - Business Analyst (BA)/Domain expert - what do your results mean in business terms.
              There will be a need to understand with the BAs, as to what your input variables mean
              and what impact your results will have on the business. To essentially understand the
              domain.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now that we have established that collaboration is important for a data scientist,
              let's talk about the ways it can become effective via code. These are the low hanging
              fruits:
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>1. Meaningful names</strong> - Your team members should not have to ask you
              what a variable means. Use names that make it very clear what the intention is. It is
              ok to have a long name. The solution to that is using better editors (by which you
              don't have to type the whole variable name every time) and not shorten the name
              thereby making it cryptic. Also, no magic numbers please.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>2. Avoid mental mapping</strong> - you know in your head which parameters in
              your code need to be changed to obtain desired result. Others don't. If you have to
              remember all the variables that need to be changed simultaneously, then you are
              wasting a lot of the team's time. Someone (including you) is going to run the code
              forgetting to change one of the variables. This means the run was a waste and the code
              will need to rerun. Considering the time some algorithms take, this should be a NO NO.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>3. Don't have multiple names for the same thing.</strong> Once you decide as a
              team, stick to it.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>4. Use business domain names.</strong> Keep your creativity to engineer
              features, analyzing, creating models. Don't invent names.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>5. Comments become obsolete very soon.</strong> Code always tells the truth.
              Hence, comments are normally discouraged. Same applies to data science code as well.
              However, I would make an exception here - add comments that reveal your intention of
              using or not using certain models/features. It is ok to comment: "This is going to
              take 5 hours" or "Using SVM with Radial basis kernel for faster convergence".
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>6. Modularize your code.</strong> It is not easy to understand one big blob.
              No matter how well it is mapped in your head right now. You will take time to
              understand it later. Others will take time to understand it. Why? Because one has to
              go through each and every line of the code to understand what it is doing. When you
              create functions that do exactly what their name says, one need not go through each
              line inside it. The reader will still understand what is being done.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>7. Don't repeat yourself!</strong> Do not copy and paste those lines of code
              because you need the exact same thing somewhere else too. Extract it in a function and
              reuse that function. This ensures consistency.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>8. Unit tests</strong> - Yes, they are very much relevant to data science
              code. Data science code is still code. Testing your functions that spit out numbers
              based on which business decisions will be taken becomes ever more paramount. Why would
              you not think of testing your functions that can have so many repercussions? All your
              functions should be tested to make sure they are doing what you expect them to do.
              Writing a function that identifies a stationary signal? Test it using a signal that is
              stationary and make sure your function returns it as such.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>9. Formatting</strong> - Decide the formatting you as a team want to follow.
              This includes using spaces vs tabs for indents, directory structure, file naming
              conventions, output results format, etc. I am all for trying out various
              approaches/models in a quick and dirty manner. This is very effective to understand
              how much and in what direction one should invest time. But once you finalize your
              approach and incorporate it in your working code, clean it up. All the above concepts
              help people work as a team. I find it useful even if I am working solo. It helps me
              understand my work later. It positions me to explain my results and allows me to cross
              examine surprising (or shocking) results quickly.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Clean Code book does a fantastic job of explaining all and more of the points
              mentioned above. So, if you are a data scientist and are going to work in a team,
              please read and implement clean code :) Every scientist has their own rules. But when
              working in a team, the team has rules.
