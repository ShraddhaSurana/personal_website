            <p>Let's get straight to the point:</p>
            <p>
              <strong>1. Post Analysis</strong> - There is no point just communicating a number. You
              have to analyse the numbers your algorithm throws out. <strong>Tie it back to the
              domain</strong>. Work with the domain experts as to what the results mean.
            </p>
            <p>
              E.g. What prices is your algorithm recommending? What does the curve (fitment) for
              these products look like? The algorithm recommends something, does it make sense? Does
              it raise any eyebrows on the results? (This can be both good if you have discovered
              something new.. Or it could mean you need to re-check your analysis). Can you as a
              human immediately put a finger on the graph as to where the price range should be?
            </p>
            <p>
              How have you verified your results? Do you know what products your algorithm is able
              to recommend prices for (fish? canned goods? wine? chocolate?)? Does it intuitively
              make sense for those products?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>2. Incorporate more features vs. add more data</strong> (or make the existing
              data more accurate). Analyse this after your initial draft (quick and dirty
              implementation) algorithm. And proceed accordingly. Don't go down a rabbit hole that
              will lead you nowhere.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>3. Use correct terminology.</strong> The problem I have with using terms in a
              wrong manner is that it gives the wrong impression, opens up space for confusion,
              invites ambiguity, showcases that you don't have enough domain knowledge and opens up
              the stage for mis-interpretation. Hence, it is extremely important to use the correct
              terminology.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>4. People!</strong> Never forget the people aspect of the project. Not only
              the people on your team, but remember that the results are being communicated to
              <strong>people</strong> - business people. Any basic course or study will tell you
              that anything is better than tables. Make the best of algorithms but if you cannot
              convey the results to your customer then it is not of much use. Conveying to your
              customer is not: "These are the numbers". It does not matter if the result is "In
              your face", you have to spend time thinking about what is the best way to convey the
              results in a manner that is <strong>understandable</strong> by the customer. Pie
              charts; bar charts; histograms; get creative. But also use relevant graphs :) According
              to me this is part of a scientist's job.
            </p>
            <p><strong>5. Clean code</strong> principles apply. See my other post on it.</p>
            <p>
              <strong>6. Use a project management software</strong> (like Jira/Trello). For
              <strong>transparency</strong> - with client and within the team. For not stepping on
              each others toes (when you have a team of data scientists working together). For being
              <strong>accountable</strong>. For easy <strong>collaboration</strong>. For easy
              retrieval of information and decisions. For easy answerability of why we chose certain
              paths or algorithms over others and where the team has spent their time. To understand
              with each piece of work, what value is it delivering.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>7. Do literature survey.</strong> Don't reinvent the wheel. Don't spend hours
              figuring out a solution that already exists. Make use of existing implementations and
              solutions. Build on them. This way you take from the community and are able to give
              back too.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>8. What does a number mean?</strong> How do your results compare with the
              industry result? Eg.: It is not enough to say: "Your score is 172". What's your
              reaction? Wouldn't you want to know "172 out of?"; "What does 172 mean? Is it better
              than others? Is that the average? Is it a good score?" Another example - Once upon a
              time in India, a class 10 student scoring 80% was fantastic! However, now most
              students score above 90% and above. I guess 98-99% must be a fantastic score these
              days. So the crucial piece of information here is the year of clearing 10th standard
              as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>9. I believe in delivering value to the client.</strong> In some cases that
              need not be delivering the final model. If you are in a situation where you know that
              the model developed may or may not work (due to various reasons - data quantity or
              quality), what value have you delivered to the client after all the months of work?
              Have they got a better insight into their data? Can all the analysis that has been
              done be reused at a later point in time? When they are equipped with better data, can
              your code be reused to accelerate the model development at that future point in time? I
              see the above at least of value. If that is in place there would be something the
              client would get, irrespective of the project's direction in the future.
            </p>
            <p><strong>10. Presentation matters. Period.</strong></p>
